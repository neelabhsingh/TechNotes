ClassCastException: You can only cast an object to its actual class or one of its supertypes. If you are wrong, a compile-time error or class cast exception will occur:
To avoid the exception, you can first test whether the object is of the desired type, using the instanceof operator. The expression

object instanceof Type

returns true if object is an instance of a class that has Type as a supertype. It is a good idea to make this check before using a cast.




The instanceof operator is null-safe: The expression obj instanceof Type is false if obj is null. After all, null cannot possibly be a reference to an object of any given type.
