Lambda expressions: Lambda expression (or function) is just an anonymous function, ie. a function with no name and without being bounded to an identifier. They are written exactly in the place where it's needed, typically as parameter to some other function.

either
(parameters) -> expression
(paramters) -> {statements;}
() -> expression

A typical lambda expression example will be like this:

(x, y) -> x + y  //This function takes two parameters and return their sum.
