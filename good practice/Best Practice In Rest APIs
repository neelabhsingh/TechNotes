Best Practice In Rest APIs

1. Use plural nouns and not verbs
Resource	   GET read	                     POST create	              PUT update	              DELETE
/fruits	       Returns a list of fruits      you have Create a new fruit  Bulk update of fruits       possibly all the 
                                                                          (you may never have to)                            
                                                                                                  
                                                                          
               
/fruits/1004
Returns a specific fruit	Method not allowed (405)	Updates a specific fruit	Deletes a specific fruit
It’s not good practice to have API endpoints like /getFruits or /delete-fruits or /createfruits. Instead, take advantage of HTTP verbs for the definitions. This means I can easily build upon your APIs and have fewer resources to manage. This approach is less ambiguous and cleaner.

GET method and its query parameters should not alter the state
Avoid designing endpoints like this

    GET /fruits/1004?avaliable=false
    GET /fruits/1004/has-finished 


    Use sub-resources for relations
Say you are designing a social network where users have blogs, you should establish relationships like this:

    GET /users/1004/blogs
This should fetch all the user’s blogs. If you want to fetch a specific blog, you can do the following:

    GET /users/1004/blogs/1010
